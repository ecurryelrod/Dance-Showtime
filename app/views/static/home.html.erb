<!-- renders partial in "performances/_performance.html.erb" and iterates over @performances array to display performance info -->

<!-- rendering a collection: -->
<!-- render(@peformances) is the collection that gets iterated over to display the attributes for each instance set in the _performance partial -->
<!-- the variable "performance" in the _performance partial is the variable getting passed into the block to display the given attributes on the page -->
<!-- as long as the collection (plural) is the same name as the variable in the block (singular) and the name of the partial (singular) then rails will recognize the iteration -->

<div><%= render(@performances, nested: false) %></div-->
